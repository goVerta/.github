Verta is a collective of engineers committed to architecting systems that are resilient by design and inevitable in operation  
Our core languages are Go Java Python  
Our focus areas are infrastructure distributed systems observability and AI driven automation

Each repository artifact embodies an axiom of operational resilience  
Each release is a statement about production readiness and long lived correctness

---

## 🔮 Mission

Design infrastructure that never pleads for mercy  
Make failure a first class citizen and make recovery a deterministic process  
Deliver systems that are understandable testable and provably observable

</p>

- Distributed topologies that absorb partial collapse without systemic failure  
- Microservice ecosystems that maintain strong contracts and graceful degradation  
- Self healing orchestration capable of automated containment and recovery loops  
- AI augmented pipelines for anomaly detection triage and remediation playbooks  
- Developer centric tools that reduce cognitive load while expanding capability

High level design principles

* Bounded contexts with explicit contracts
* Event driven backbone for eventual consistency and operational cohesion
* Observability first design with traces metrics logs and derived signals
* Immutable infrastructure with declarative orchestration and policy as code

---

## 📦 Core Components

* API Gateway with typed schemas and strict rate enforcement
* Auth Service with multi factor capability and short lived tokens
* Event Mesh with guaranteed once semantics and programmable retention policies
* Worker Pool with autoscaling driven by SLO aware policies
* Telemetry Stack with correlated traces adaptive metrics and alerting playbooks

---

## 💡 Design Principles

* Minimal surface area for catastrophic failure
* Deterministic recovery paths for every class of failure
* Fail fast recover faster philosophy for bounded blast radius
* Observability at pipeline speed not at release speed
* Secure by default with zero trust assumptions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Snapshot

* Languages Go Java Python
* Data stores scalable SQL and distributed NoSQL
* Messaging Kafka compatible event mesh
* Orchestration Kubernetes with operator driven control planes
* CI CD pipelines declarative with policy gates and canary promotion
* Telemetry OpenTelemetry Prometheus Grafana tracing backend

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/verta/official-readme.git
cd official-readme
make bootstrap
make test unit
make deploy staging
```

Notes for maintainers

* Tests must be green for any merge into main
* Every service must publish schema changes with a compatibility strategy
* Releases require changelog entry and observability playbook

---

## 🔬 Observability and SLOs

* Define objective SLOs per service with clear error budgets
* Instrument traces for critical paths and sample adaptively for high volume flows
* Use derived metrics to trigger automated containment actions before human paging

---

## 🔒 Security Model

* Least privilege at every layer
* Signed artifacts and reproducible builds for release integrity
* Continuous vulnerability scanning with automated mitigations where feasible

---

## 📜 Governance and Contribution

* Contribution requires a design doc linked to the issue
* Design doc must include failure modes mitigations and observability plan
* Code reviews must validate invariants tests and rollout plan
* Maintainers operate on duty rotation with documented escalation paths

---

## 🧾 Roadmap Highlights

* Phase 1 Provide production hardened event mesh and SLO library
* Phase 2 Integrate AI driven incident triage into runbooks
* Phase 3 Deliver policy as code enforcement across CI CD and runtime
